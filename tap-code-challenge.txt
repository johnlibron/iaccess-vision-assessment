Problem:

I have 3 environments where my apps are deployed: DEV, STAGE and PROD
I have 2 applications using this setup: app1, app2
In these environments, i keep a list of ips which identifies the list of clients that are allowed to access my apps
A client can have 1 or more ip addresses
An ip address can be associated to 1 or more clients

We want a webservice which can provide RESTful endpoints and serve the following functionality:
- add a client ip (IPv4 only) to the whitelist specific to an environment and app
- provide the list of ips without duplicates; can filtered by environment, app and/or client name
- remove a client ip from the list

Code Submission Requirements:
1. Use java and spring solution.
2. Add a readme file which includes how to run/use/test your app. if your app is able to host or include a generated 'how to use my web service' it would be cool but not required
3. Use file as the persistence db
4. Security for the endpoints is not necessary; You can add one if you want.
6. Apply REST best practices in terms of endpoint design, proper status xheaders for the operations, correct use of HTTP Verbs, content negotiation and entity representation.
7. support json and xml as content-type
